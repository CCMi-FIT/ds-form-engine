# Form Engine

Simple DOM-based form engine to be used with http://haste-lang.org.

- [A trivial example](https://github.com/DataStewardshipPortal/ds-form-example)
- [A complex questionnaire](https://github.com/DataStewardshipPortal/ds-elixir-cz) built with Form Engine, including the server side and persistency.

## TODO

### Functionality
- Recursive validation of group elements
- Submission validation

### Refactoring
- refactor for speed using direct DOM or server-side rendering
